3. Yes, I'm surprised computer programmers are projected to have a 9% decline over the next 10 years. I always figured that AI would not cause issues in the job market this soon, but it makes sense as the types of problems that programmers solve are often easily done by AI.
4. **In order from best to worst:**
- Software developer: I really like coding and creating things like web apps, the salary is good, and the projected job market growth for this path is still good
- Data Scientist: I really like thinking about problems like how to ideally store data for large applications and how to develop insights about datasets in general. The strong projected growth is also promising.
- Computer Programmer: This would be my ideal job, creating algorithms and solutions to problems for various types of things, but the decline in the job market is worrying.
- Computer Network Support Specialist: This seems interesting to me, but the over 40 hours per week of working scares me away slightly as I have done jobs with those hours in the past and not liked it. 
- Computer Hardware Specialist: This seems like an interesting career path, but the research lab setting would not be a perfect match for me.
- Computer User Support Specialist: I like how simple this job seems, but the lack of a high salary and the need to work on some nights/weekends deters me.
- Broadcast/Sound/Video Technician: I really like creating and working with media, but the salary is just not sufficient in my opinion to support a large family given current economic trends. 
- Financial risk specialist: I like the data driven aspects of this job but the work-life balance does not seem ideal.
